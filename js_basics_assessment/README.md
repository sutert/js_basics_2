This assessment will test your knowledge of variables, conditionals, functions arrays, and loops. Fork and clone the following starter repo and get started solving some problems with JavaScript! Please submit to link to your forked GitHub repo to be graded. Make sure you commit and push your changes before submitting.

***And without further ado, your problem-set:***

## Virginia

Count the number of times you find "Virginia" in a string that is unreasonably long and full of strange characters.

## Ascii art lol

We are using JavaScript to display some cool art in our HTML page but something isn't right. See if you can review scramble.js to help you understand what you have to do to the artArray in `exercise02.js` before `writeAscii()` uses it to display the messed-up image on the page.

## Gettysburg

You are provided a string representation of the Gettysburg Address. Write a function that prints one word of the Gettysburg Address at a time in the console.

## Fizz Buzz

FizzBuzz is a common programming puzzle. It requires that you use both loops and conditionals. Variations of this puzzle are widely used as an initial screening question during job interviews. Because this is a classic puzzle, it's easy to look up solutions online. It will be good practice for you to first try to solve the puzzle yourself before searching online.

- Write a function named `fizzBuzz` that takes one parameter: `maxValue`.
- This function should loop through 1â€”`maxValue` (inclusive) and build a string with the following conditions:
  1. If a number is even, concatenate `"Fizz, "` to the end of the string.
  2. If a number is a multiple of 3, concatenate `"Buzz, "` to the end of the string.
  3. If a number is both even and a multiple of 3, concatenate `"FizzBuzz, "` to the end of the string.
  4. If a number is neither even or a multiple of 3, concatenate the number and `", "` to the end of the string.
  5. This function should `console.log()` the final string after `maxValue` iterations of the loop.

## Example

`fizzBuzz(12)` should display the string `1, Fizz, Buzz, Fizz, 5, FizzBuzz, 7, Fizz, Buzz, Fizz, 11, FizzBuzz, `


## DOM-ination

In this exercise you are provided some HTML. Follow the instructions in `exercise05.js` to manipulate the DOM in various ways with JavaScript.

## setTimeout

For this exercise you will be working with the `setTimeout()` function in JavaScript. Your task is to update some text in the HTML file 3 seconds after the page has loaded. See `exercise06.js` for all the details.

## Images In Time

For this exercise you will add a random image to the page every 2.5 seconds using the `setTimeout()` function in JavaScript. This would be easier with `setInterval()` but what fun would easy be? Don't worry, we have included some hints in `exercise07.js`
